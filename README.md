# comp110-evaluation

##Week 1  
For semester 2, I have looked at my previous evaluation and implement some of these SMART actions and weaknesses to my work. For the first week, we were introduced to the modules and assignments. As my first SMART action, this week I should approach the course start with suitable time management. I have already started to work on my hardware project over the break and continue with my practise. Next week I'll have a working circuit that is a copy of a typical controller that is practised on a game.  
Specific - Continue to prototype hardware controller  
Measurable - Have a controller that can play a game using WASD and space  
Achievable - These controls are easily found on the back and should improve practise of prototyping  
Relevant - The design for a controller is used for COMP140 which requires a functional prototype for a game  
Time-bound - Next week, I'll check to see if I have produced a working prototype  

##Week 2  
Our project presentation takes place on friday, so my communication and practise of paper prototype is used. Work on hardware project. While working on the makeymakey kit I have seen a variety of different approaches to making a controller. The scope of this project is reflected in my designs and shouldn't attempt to be too ambicious or the project won't be completed. As my second SMART action, I should approach my github submissions with more frequent push and pull requests.  
Specific - Make sure to upload submissions for each assignment showing work done this week  
Measurable - At least one push for COMP110, COMP140, COMP150  
Achievable - This could be research, design ideas, worksheet 4 improvements of evaluation update  
Relevant - Each of these subjects are ongoing projects that require frequent github submissions to achieve high marks  
Time-bound - Next week, I'll check to see if I have uploaded 1 think for each of these projects  

##Week 3
For this week we have been working more on understind OOP, in particular, towards our group project games. In addition to this, we have been incorporating agile and scrum work flow into our agile essay proposal and group project. I have written my proposal for my essay and should aim to improve upon the issues I discusses in my previous evaluation. In particular, I should aim to improve my academic structure and focus for my essay. I have struggled understanding the live coding sessions involving OOP and often got lost in the thought process of why and how things were done. My confidence is preventing me from asking questions which only furthers the issue.  
Specific - Review the OOP live coding sections and make a object class for player  
Measurable - The player class works in the same way as coin and spike  
Achievable - The basic code is on github and should be able to duplicate a similar result  
Relevant - This would be used in my group project for object classes  
Time-bound - Next week, if I can't complete this task, I should approach my lecturer    

##Week 4
For this week, we have been on our hardware project where I discussed with my lecturer how to make my circuitry more tidy. This was an issue as the inability to solder and fix the wires to the makeymakey board meant that the stability of my controller was low. I should attempt to make my container for the board and wiring more transportable with the construction of the container top priority. Also, this week we have been working on our group projects and have made implementations for sprite and platform rendering as well as character movement. I struggled with the comp 110 worksheet 5 A* pathfinding, which I approach Ed about. For next week, I should attempt the worksheet and submit a pull request with an errors and issues.
Specific - Attempt A* pathfinding worksheet  
Measurable - Implement a working A* pathfinding  
Achievable - The pseudocode has been given as well as additional aupport, so an attempt is achieveable  
Relevant - This is for worksheet 5 and useful for our comp 150 group project  
Time-bound - Next week, if I can't complete this task, I should approach my lecturer and submit a pull request  

##Week 5
This week, we were able to discussion our issues with the A* pathfinding as a class, where we were given additional support work this worksheet. I struggled with shared pointed and so this workshop improved my knowledge so that I can attempt to worksheet again. Another task we took part in class was a heuristic review of our peers controllers which also provided feedback for final prototyping. The controller deadline is my priority, so I should set my SMART action to this task.
Specific - Make final prototype controller  
Measurable - Have a functional controller  
Achievable - The previous prototypes, materials avaliable and feedback provided is enough to make a final prototype  
Relevant - This is for comp 140 hacking  
Time-bound - If I have any issues over the week, I should approach my lecturers before Monday
