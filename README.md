# comp110-evaluation
An evaluation of your progress in Semester 2.

##Week 1  
For semester 2, I have looked at my previous evaluation and implement some of these SMART actions and weaknesses to my work. For the first week, we were introduced to the modules and assignments. As my first SMART action, this week I should approach the course start with suitable time management. I have already started to work on my hardware project over the break and continue with my practise. Next week I'll have a working circuit that is a copy of a typical controller that is practised on a game.

##Week 2  
Our project presentation takes place on friday, so my communication and practise of paper prototype is used. Work on hardware project.
